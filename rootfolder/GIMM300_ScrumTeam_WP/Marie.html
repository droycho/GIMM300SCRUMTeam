	  <h3>Marie Shirley</h3>				
    			<p>I am a student at Boise State University majoring in Gaming, Interactive
       			Media, and Mobile Technologies with minors in Computer Science and Cyber
       			Security.
     			</p>
			
     			<p>I am a member of the NASA SUITS Team. This year, we will be addressing
        		the Spacesuit User Interface Technologies for Students (SUITS) challenge
        		posed by NASA with enhancements to the Augmented Reality Space
        		Informatics System 2.0  (ARSIS 2.0) that the team designed in 2018.
        		ARSIS is an AR user interface (UI) system built for Microsoft HoloLens
        		to assist crewmembers in extra-vehicular activities (EVA) with the
        		use of anchored instructions, visual communication with Mission
        		Control, translational maps, eye tracking, and voice controls.
     			</p>
		
     			<p>Additionally, I intern for a local start-up performing user interface/
       			user experience (UI/UX) testing.
     			</p>
		
     			<p>I am currently enrolled in GIMM 300: Mobile Web Development. This course
        		will provide me with a solid foundation in front-end development as well
        		as a philosophical understanding of the implications of this ability.
     			</p>
		
     			<p>The Gaming, Interactive Media and Mobile Technologies (GIMM) program has
        		provided me with a well-rounded skill set which will allow me to
        		effectively and creatively produce cutting-edge technology. Upon
        		graduation in May of 2020, these skills will provide for a wide range
        		of opportunities, though I am particularly interested in Augmented
        		Reality development.
