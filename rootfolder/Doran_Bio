    I am currently a student at Boise State University enrolled in "Games, interactive Media, and Mobile technologies", GIMM for short. 
        I consider myself an avid outdoorsman and enjoy many activies such as mountain biking, hiking, camping, and fly fishing. 
        When I am not enjoying the outdoors I am Studying Artificial Intelligance, and Developing iOS Apps to further my worth as an up 
        and coming developer.
